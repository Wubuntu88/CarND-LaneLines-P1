**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline is in my process_image2() method in my P1 jupyter notebook.
There are 6 steps in my pipeline:
1) Convert to greyscale
2) Apply Canny Edge detection to image.
3) Apply Gaussian smoothing to the image (not explicitly listed in the process_image2() method; applied in step 2's method).
4) Define a region of interest, and bitwise and the image with that region to exclude non-lane-line-items.
5) Calculate the hough lines.
6) Draw lines on image by using the hould lines as input.

## Detailed Description of Each Step

# 1) Convert to greyscale
My first step was to create a greyscale image.I did so with the following function:

greyscale_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
